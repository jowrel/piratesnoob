<h2>Pirates III - A World's End</h2>
<p div class="pone">To control the oceans, Lord Cutler Beckett kills anyone associated with piracy and uses Davy Jones to destroy all pirate ships on the seas. Condemned prisoners sing "Hoist the Colours" to compel the nine pirate lords comprising the Brethren Court to convene at Shipwreck Cove; however, the late Captain Jack Sparrow, pirate lord of the Caribbean, never appointed a successor and pass on his piece of eight. Captain Barbossa leads Will, Elizabeth, Tia Dal ma and the crew of the Black Pearl to rescue Jack from Davy Jones's Locker. Sao Feng, pirate lord of the South China Sea, possesses a map to the Locker, where Jack is imprisoned. Will bargains with Feng for the Pearl in exchange for Sparrow, so Will can re scue his father from Davy Jones' ship, The Flying Dutchman. Meanwhile, Davy Jones - under the control of Lord Beckett - destroys several pirate ships and leaves no survivors. This leads to Beckett confronting Jones to announce his decision to place the Ch est of Davy Jones on board his ship and place Royal Marines to guard it under the command of the very man who stole Jones' heart, Admiral James Norrington. The crew journeys into the Locker and retrieves Sparrow. As the Pearl seeks an escape route, dead s ouls float past, including Elizabeth's father Weatherby Swann, who was murdered by Beckett. Tia Dalma reveals that Davy Jones was appointed by Calypso, his lover and goddess of the Sea, to ferry the dead to the next world; in return, Jones could step upon land for one day every ten years to be with his love. When she failed to meet him, he abandoned his duty and transformed into a monster. After returning to the living world, the Pearl is ambushed by Sao Feng, who reveals his agreement with Will. Feng betr ays Will, handing over the crew to Beckett in exchange for the Pearl. .

But, Jack Sparrow escaped three days later and kept thepistol for ten years; saving the bullet to kill Captain Barbossa. The pirates spent the treasure but learned itwas cursed, turning them into immortal skeletal beings whose true forms are revealed in moonlight.

Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow:An eccentric pirate noted for a slightly drunken swagger, accompanied by slurred speech and awkwardlyflailing hand gestures. He has gained a reputation with made-up stories of how he escaped from thedeserted island he was put on. He is determined to regain the Black Pearl, which he captained ten yearsbefore. The role was originally written especially for Hugh Jackman, thus the name "Jack Sparrow";however, he was not well known outside of his native Australia, so Disney cast the more famous Depp asJack. Depp found the script quirky: rather than trying to find treasure, the crew of the Black Pearl weretrying to return it in order to lift their curse; also, the traditional mutiny had already taken place. InitiallySparrow was, according to Bruckheimer, "a young Burt Lancaster, just the cocky pirate." At the first read-through, Depp surprised the rest of the cast and crew by portraying the character in an off-kilter manner.After researching 18th-century pirates, Depp compared them to modern rock stars and decided to base hisperformance on Keith Richards, who would later appear in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.Although Verbinski and Bruckheimer had confidence in Depp, partly because it would be Bloom whowas playing the traditional Errol Flynn-type, Disney executives were confused, asking Depp whether thecharacter was drunk or gay, and Michael Eisner even proclaimed while watching rushes, "He's ruining thefilm!" Depp answered back, "Look, these are the choices I made. You know my work. So either trust meor give me the boot.
