<h2>Pirates II - The Dead Man's Chest</h2>
<p div class="pone">On their wedding day Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann are confronted by Lord Cutler Beckett, head of the East India Trading Company, with arrest warrants for their helping pirate Captain Jack Sparrow escape execution. Former Commodore Norrington is also wan ted for delaying the pursuit of Sparrow, but Norrington has resigned from the British Royal Navy months prior and disappeared. Elizabeth is thrown in prison. Beckett sends Will to recover Jack's compass in exchange for letters of marque that will make Spar row a British privateer, and he promises Will and Elizabeth pardons. Will's father Bootstrap Bill Turner tells Jack he must keep his own promise to join the crew of Davy Jones, who raised the sunken Black Pearl for him years ago. When Jack refuses, Bootst rap tells him Davy's "pet" will drag him to Davy Jones' Locker. Will finds the Black Pearl at Pelegosto, where a cannibal tribe worships Jack as a god, planning to kill him to release him from his "human state". After a jungle chase, Jack, Will, Joshamee G ibbs and remnants of the Pearl's crew escape to the ship. Meanwhile Elizabeth's father frees her, though he is himself captured, and she steals the letters of marque and stows away on a ship to find Will and Jack.

That night Port Royal is besieged by thePearl, answering the medallion's pulse. Elizabeth is captured and invokesparley. She negotiates for thepirates to stop attacking Port Royal in exchange for the medallion and, believing they intend to harm herfather through her, falsely tells Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) that her surname is "Turner". CaptainBarbossa agrees but keeps Elizabeth prisoner on the ship, believing she is the key to breaking a horriblecurse they are under.Will Turner, who loves Elizabeth, suggests that they make a deal with Captain Jack Sparrow to lead themto the Black Pearl, but Commodore Norrington refuses. Will then persuades Jack Sparrow to help himrescue her in exchange for Jack's freedom. Jack agrees after learning Will's surname is "Turner",believing he can use Will to reclaim the Pearl. Will and Jack commandeer the HMS Interceptor andrecruit a crew in Tortugawith help from Jack's old friend, Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally). They set sailfor Isla de Muerta, as Jack knows the pirates will go there to break the curse.Will learns Jack was once captain of the Pearl, questing for Aztec gold, when Barbossa, Jack's first mateat the time, mutinied and marooned him on an island. Following the Pirate Code, Barbossa gave Jack apistol with a single shot, intended for suicide.

But, Jack Sparrow escaped three days later and kept thepistol for ten years; saving the bullet to kill Captain Barbossa. The pirates spent the treasure but learned itwas cursed, turning them into immortal skeletal beings whose true forms are revealed in moonlight. Thecurse can be lifted if the coins and each pirate's blood is returned to the chest. William "Bootstrap Bill"Turner, Jack's only supporter, sent a coin to his son, Will, believing the crew should remain cursed.Barbossa had Bootstrap Turner tied to a cannon and thrown overboard, only later to learn his blood wasneeded to break the curse.At Isla de Muerta, Captain Barbossa, believing Elizabeth is Bootstrap Turner's child, anoints the last coinwith her blood and drops it into the chest; the curse remains unbroken. After reaching the island, Willsuspects Jack Sparrow may betray him and knocks him out. He rescues Elizabeth and they escape to theInterceptor leaving Jack behind. Jack barters with Captain Barbossa, offering Bootstrap Turner's child inexchange for the Pearl, but Barbossa rejects his offer and pursues the Interceptor. Captain Barbossa's crewsinks the Interceptor and imprisons the crew. Will reveals he is Bootstrap Bill Turner's son and demandsthat Elizabeth and the crew be freed, or he will shoot himself and fall overboard, foiling CaptainBarbossa's plan to break the curse. Captain Barbossa agrees but applies another loophole, marooningElizabeth and Jack on the island Jack was on ten years earlier. Will is taken to Isla de Muerta, to be killedto break the curse. Elizabeth discovers how Jack escaped: the island was used as a cache by rum runnersand Jack managed to barter passage off.Elizabeth burns the cache of rum to create a signal fire that Commodore Norrington's ship spots.

Sheconvinces Commodore Norrington to rescue Will by accepting his marriage proposal. Returning to Isla deMuerta, Commodore Norrington sets an ambush while Jack persuades Captain Barbossa to form analliance. He tells him to delay breaking the curse until they have taken Commodore Norrington's ship, theDauntless. Jack's plan goes awry when Barbossa orders his crew to infiltrate the Dauntless fromunderwater. Elizabeth infiltrates the Pearl and frees Jack's crew. They leave with the Pearl while Elizabeth heads to the island and saves Will while Jack battles Captain Barbossa. It is then revealed that Jack hadtaken a medallion from the chest during the earlier negotiations to become immortal so that he could fightBarbossa without fear of death. Norrington spots his ship under attack and orders his men to return. They make it to the ship and engagethe cursed pirates. Meanwhile, when Barbossa attempts to kill Elizabeth, Jack shoots Barbossa as Willdrops the last two medallions, stained with his and Jack's blood, into the chest. No longer immortal,Barbossa collapses and dies. The now-mortal pirates aboard the Dauntlesssurrender.At Port Royal, Will attempts to rescue Jack from hanging. Both are captured.

The film ends with Jack looking at his compass while singing "APirate's Life for Me".In a post-credits scene, Captain Barbossa's monkey finds his body. The monkey picks up the coins whichhave blood on them and becomes a skeleton again.

Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow:An eccentric pirate noted for a slightly drunken swagger, accompanied by slurred speech and awkwardlyflailing hand gestures. He has gained a reputation with made-up stories of how he escaped from thedeserted island he was put on. He is determined to regain the Black Pearl, which he captained ten yearsbefore. The role was originally written especially for Hugh Jackman, thus the name "Jack Sparrow";however, he was not well known outside of his native Australia, so Disney cast the more famous Depp asJack. Depp found the script quirky: rather than trying to find treasure, the crew of the Black Pearl weretrying to return it in order to lift their curse; also, the traditional mutiny had already taken place. InitiallySparrow was, according to Bruckheimer, "a young Burt Lancaster, just the cocky pirate." At the first read-through, Depp surprised the rest of the cast and crew by portraying the character in an off-kilter manner.After researching 18th-century pirates, Depp compared them to modern rock stars and decided to base hisperformance on Keith Richards, who would later appear in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.Although Verbinski and Bruckheimer had confidence in Depp, partly because it would be Bloom whowas playing the traditional Errol Flynn-type, Disney executives were confused, asking Depp whether thecharacter was drunk or gay, and Michael Eisner even proclaimed while watching rushes, "He's ruining thefilm!" Depp answered back, "Look, these are the choices I made. You know my work. So either trust meor give me the boot.
